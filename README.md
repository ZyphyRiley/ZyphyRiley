# Hello!
I'm Riley, a 4th year Computer Engineering student at the University of British Columbia. I'm still currently exploring technology and what I want to focus on, but I am currently interested in computer architecture, machine learning applications, and game design (maybe a mixture of all three). I also enjoy listening/creating music and gaming!

# Project Experience

## Laser Tag with the DE1-SoC
### Summary
The DE1-SoC is a hardware design platform, complete with FPGA, memory, and ports for Ethernet, audio, and video. This project used the DE1-SoC as a hub for the purpose of a home laser tag game, where the DE1-SoC would broadcast its location and status to other players' phones as they tried to hunt it down. I developed the firmware for the WiFi, video broadcast, and light sensing capabilities of the DE1-SoC using C and the Eclipse IDE. Everything was put together on the DE1-SoC using Quartus Platform Designer. 
### Tools
- C
- Eclipse
- Quartus
- SystemVerilog

## Tidder Forum
### Summary
Tidder was a project similar to Reddit for the purposes of learning and using relational databases. My project partners and I created an ER diagram showing the relationships between the different objects in our application, then wrote SQL to realize it.
