# Hello!
I'm Riley, a 4th year Computer Engineering student at the University of British Columbia. I'm still currently exploring technology and what I want to focus on, but I am currently interested in computer architecture, machine learning applications, and game design (maybe a mixture of all three). I also enjoy listening/creating music and gaming!
